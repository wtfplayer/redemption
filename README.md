# About
I'll be posting my scripts into this repository, if I put someone elses script into this repository that just means I revamped their script. I'll be putting some scripts and info into the [README.md](https://github.com/wtfplayer/redemption/blob/main/README.md)

The scripts will be put into sections. (sections in the README.md btw)

Contact me on discord (**folixx**) or twitter (**zxfolix**)
I honestly don't put effort on updating the readme, so don't expect me to add the info right away.
