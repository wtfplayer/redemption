# Starting off
I will be posting script each month into this repository and adding the information in the readme.
The scripts will be put into sections. The scripts I put into here are meant for pranking in irl and trolling.
Don't go around talking about this before its gets patched ðŸ’€

# Crash Script
The "crash" script, that basically just makes a fake screen that makes it look like you're banned but you're really not. (good for trolling)

Contact me on discord (**folixx**) or twitter (**zxfolix**)
I honestly don't put effort on updating the readme, so this is probably what is gonna stay in the readme, useful information.

# Script

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wtfplayer/redemption/main/crash"))()
```
