# REMINDERS
I'll be posting my scripts and if I put someone elses into this repository that means it's either my friends script or a revamp of their script and I'll be adding the information into the readme.

The scripts will be put into sections. The scripts I put into here are meant for pranking in irl and trolling.
Don't go around talking about this before they get patched ðŸ’€ No one want's scripts to get patched ;)

Contact me on discord (**folixx**) or twitter (**zxfolix**)
I honestly don't put effort on updating the readme, so don't expect me to add the info right away.
