RejectCharacterDeletions
Is a work-around to ROBLOX's most RejectCharacterDeletions update RejectCharacteDeletions prevents player's from deleting objects in the character, thus allowing them to "control" them.

This isn't technically a bypass, but a work-around.

( PS: YOU CANNOT MOVE LIMBS. ONLY ACCESSORIES. )
Eitherway, enjoy the work-around originally by @Ficelloo

loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dex4tw/RejectCharacterDeletions/main/RCDBypass.lua"))()
YOU MUST WRITE YOUR OWN CODE AFTER LOADING THE STRING.
Netless
Additionally, if you are in a game that does not have workspace.RejectCharacterDeletions set to true, you can run this.

loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dex4tw/RejectCharacterDeletions/main/AcessoryNetless.lua"))()
This allows you to move your hats around while preventing them from falling. ( You may edit the Velocity in the source-code )
