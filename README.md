# Starting
I'll be posting scripts into this repository and adding the information in the readme.

The scripts will be put into sections. The scripts I put into here are meant for pranking in irl and trolling.
Don't go around talking about this before they get patched ðŸ’€ No one want's scripts to get patched ;)

# Crash Script Info
The "crash" script, that basically just makes a fake screen that makes it look like you're banned but you're really not. (good for trolling)

Contact me on discord (**folixx**) or twitter (**zxfolix**)
I honestly don't put effort on updating the readme, so don't expect me to add the info right away.
